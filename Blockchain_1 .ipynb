    "## A bit about me:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I am a Machine Learning Engineer Consultant and\n",
    "- wrote a book about Machine Learning with scikit-learn. \n",
    "- I started doing Data Science at Ayaakua about 6 years ago using Neural Networks to find the skeletons/frames of figures. \n",
    "- I preferred this procedure __over writing an algorithm myself__ which was quite difficult and prone to errors for strange cases: numerous edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "I work mostly on AI for Computer Vision or Finance. I like roughly three model types:\n",
    "- Neural Networks for Computer Vision/Natural Language Processing\n",
    "- Gradient Boosting Machines\n",
    "- Simple Linear/Polynomial Models\n",

    "## Ayaakua: start-up out of Harvard/Harvard Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ayaakua was started out of Harvard.\n",

    "Jose and Nodari are the TAs for this course. They have an extensive background. I will let them share their background with you in their sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What about Blockchain?\n",
    "\n",
    "About me and Blockchain: My first project with Blockchain was building a Fingerprint Database Blockchain Prototype.\n",
    "\n",
    "...it was a Database which as input took fingerprints and a user was allowed to log into a system or not using crytographic hashing. The Database itself was private. Note that companies can use private/public Blockchains/Security systems.\n",

    "__A Visual Image of Blockchain: the Blockchain Database__\n",

    "__First definition of Blockchain: Ledger/Database:__\n",

    "\n",
    "### This could suggest that Mathematics is useful for Programming...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Formally, Programming is Mathematical: it obeys a finite system of rules/axioms.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Practically, there is some fine-detail in programming that is far away from Theoretical Math: a bug from a program that you need fixed right away is far from Theoretical Math.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Practically, what about AI?: Is there some math there?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overall: Math and Physics operate from \"Basic Principles\". If you would like to use Math in programming you definitely can. I myself do. Also, this class is offered in the Harvard Dept. of Mathematics & Computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Basic Principles\" -> Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "- Physics (light frequencies) -> Painting\n",
    "- Physics (audio frequencies) -> Music\n",
    "- Math -> CS (Binary math usually)\n",
    "- Theorist -> Making a Product/Application\n",
    "- Design an ML Algorithm -> Apply Random Forest within a product and deploy\n",
    "- Academia -> Industry\n",

    "## A Note on Blackboxes\n",
    "\n",
    "The course is based on Modules and Modular Thought.\n",

    "Sometimes you do not understand what is in the Black-box.\n",
    "In programming teams: you usually understand the Black-box you work on: everyone else understands the inputs/outputs only. (Also, sometimes you forget exactly what is in a Black-box and you must prepare for that.)\n",

    "## Python/Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "- When developing in Jupyter make sure to reflect and use best-practices in regards to software-engineering.\n",
    "    - PEP8 guidelines are a good example\n",
    "    - some best practices and methodologies are in the documentation:\n",
    "        - part of ML I learned was reading the documentation that alluded to (from my perspective):\n",
    "            - AutoML\n",
    "            - hyper-parameter optimization\n",
    "    - Python methodologies:\n",
    "        - code usually easy to read and relatively easy to write\n",
    "        - language is welcoming to beginners\n",
    "\n",
    "- Important point on Python/Jupyter:\n",
    "    - Python is great for prototyping code and understanding code. \n",
    "    - We will use that property to eventually simulate Blockchain ideas. \n",
    "    - Recall however that Jupyter is new: Legacy C++ systems, for example, are structured/made differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Bitcoin Blockchain was originally an experiment which thankfully worked and led to decentralized transactions.\n",
    "    - Bitcoin is leading the Blockchain market\n",
    "    - Ethereum is next\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Why IPython/Jupyter?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "- IPython/Jupyter Notebooks are mainstream in Data Science and Data Science presentations. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Personally, I wrote a programming book using Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Additionally, they are good for \n",
    "    - quickly testing code, \n",
    "    - making unit tests,\n",
    "    - demoing,\n",
    "    - and visualizing quickly. For example, one can make a quick test of code in a single cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A quick visualization in a Notebook reveals whether an algorithm will potentially work or fail. If it fails, one has to go back yet there is usually not much wasted time. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It is easy to make demo-videos in Jupyter (as opposed to writing a complete app for the demo stage.) \n",
    "\n",
    "- The last benefit I encountered in Jupyter is the easy learning of new Python libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are starting to take hold at mayor companies, for example Netflix:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/notebook-innovation-591ee3221233\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons:\n",
    "- Watch out for: not being able to write code by hand: or becoming over-dependent on this style of writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Blockchain uses\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unicef is using blockchain as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "### \" Blockchain technologies are introducing new systems of trust and exchange on which users can send value directly from one party to another without the need for intermediaries. \"\n",
    "\n",
    "http://unicefstories.org/blockchain/\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blockchain can reduce the cost of handling donations by eliminating third-parties involved in transferring money from donors to those who administer aid to individuals needing help. The work at Unicef emphasizes how Blockchain ideas can reduce transaction costs and help banking/society in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blockchain is not all about the Bitcoin market and its abrupt changes in price. (Although, note that Bitcoin is the public image of the Blockchain at times.)"
